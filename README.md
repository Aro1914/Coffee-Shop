# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Full Stack Nano - IAM Final Project

Its a coffee shop alright, but a unique one.  
Ever heard of a shop that only showcases coffee?  
Yeah, not serve, not sell, showcase! Its a shop for coffee on display!

## App features

So how does the app work, and what features are open to users who register in the app?

For all users the app grants the following features:

- Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
- Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.

For baristas and managers (users with special privileges) the app grants them the following features:

- Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
- Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

## About the Stack
